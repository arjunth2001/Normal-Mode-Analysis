# Normal-Mode-Analysis
Science-2 Project for Analysing the Normal Modes of an Argon System of 108 atoms following the Lennard Jones Potential. The code generates a initial random configuration of 108 atoms based on the given conditions, implements Periodic Boundary Conditions, Reduces the system of the random configuration using the Steepest Descent Algorithm for minimisation, then it generates a Hessian Matrix , and the eigen values and eigen vectors for it. It also plots a histogram of the frequencies.
